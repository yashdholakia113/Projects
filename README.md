# 1. Data Analysis and Data Visualization: using python’s NumPy, Pandas, Matlplotlib, Seaborn in this project.	Datasets included 911 calls and different banking stocks.

# 2. Deep Learning: Classified note as authentic or not based on TensorFlow using 4 different features to classify the note from bank_authentication dataset.It includes DNNClassifer and  TensorFlow estimators.  I have also comapred TensorFlow’s accuracy with Random Forest classifier.

# 3. K-means: Used K-MEANS clustering to determine whether the university is public or private. It is unsupervised learning technique so accuracy cannot be fund out, but since the labels are available so I  determined accuracy of K-means clustering which is only 29% in this case.

# 4. KNN,SVM,DC,FR: Compared Decsision Trees, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine. The better model was determined by using classification report and confusion matrix. The models had to classify the type of IRIS based on Sepal length and width, petal length and width. The hyperparameters of KNN (the value of k) was determined by using elbow method. The hyperparameters of Support Vector Machine was determined by using grid search algorithm. The hyperparameters of Random Forest was determined by using Bias-Variance tradeoff. Decision trees had precision, recall and f1-score of 96% each. Random Forest had precision, recall and f1-score of 94% each. KNN had precision, recall and f1-score of 98% each. Support Vector Machines had precision, recall and f1-score of 96% each. Thus, for this given dataset, KNN was the better model as compared to other three.

# 5 Linear Regression: Performed linear regression to predict yearly amount spent based on 4 different features and determined strongest feature. The accuracy was evaluated based on Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error.

# 6. Logistic Regression: Implemented Logistic Regression to predict whether a user will click on ad or not. Method get_dummies() was applied to convert categorical data to numeric data.	Received precision, recall and f1-score of 92% each.

# 7. NLP:  Performed feature extraction.  Classified the user reviews as 1-star or 5-star based on  yelp dataset.
